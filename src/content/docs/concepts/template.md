An Concept Explanation deepens and broadens the reader’s understanding of a subject. It brings clarity, light and context.

Explanation - understanding oriented, theoretical knowledge, that serves our study
The concept of reflection is important. Reflection occurs after something else, and depends on something else, yet at the same time brings something new - shines a new light - on the subject matter.

The perspective of explanation is higher and wider than that of the other not types. It does not take the user’s eye-level view, as in a how-to guide, or a close-up view of the machinery, like reference material. Its scope in each case is a topic - “an area of knowledge”, that somehow has to be bounded in a reasonable, meaningful way.

Explanations motivate why things are the way they are.
