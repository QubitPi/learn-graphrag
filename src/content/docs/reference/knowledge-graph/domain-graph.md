A Domain Graph contains Business Domain Knowledge. It contains real-world entities and the relationships between them. Frequently used example Domain Graphs are the Movie Graph or the Northwind Graph.  
Since Domain Graphs will look very different based on the underlying Domain it is not possible to provide a blueprint of how a Domain Graph would look.
