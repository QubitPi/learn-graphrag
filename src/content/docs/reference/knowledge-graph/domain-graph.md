A Domain Graph contains Business Domain Knowledge. It contains real-world entities and the relationships between them. 
Frequently used example Domain Graphs are the Movie Graph or the Northwind Graph.  

Since Domain Graphs will look different based on the underlying domain, it isnâ€™t possible to provide a blueprint of how one would look. 
Just keep in mind that they contain structured data adhering to a schema.

Providing the information contained in a Domain Graph within a question-answer application where natural language queries lead to (deterministic) structured retrieval of data can be executed in several ways.
