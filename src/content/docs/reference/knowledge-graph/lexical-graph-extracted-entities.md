title: Lexical Graph with Extracted Entities
description: A Lexical Graph that additionally contains extracted entities and relationships.

## Context

The biggest problem with the vector search approach as in the e.g. [Basic Retrievers](/reference/graphrag/basic-retriever) or [Parent-Child Retrievers](/reference/graphrag/parent-child-retriever) is finding all relevant context that is necessary to answer a question. The context can be spread across many chunks not being found by the search. Relating the real-world entities from the chunks to each other and retrieving these relationships together with a vector search provides additional context about these entities that the chunks deal with.

## Graph Pattern

## Elements

### Nodes

![Document Node](../../../../assets/images/element-document-node.svg)
Document nodes contain the document name and its source. They may contain additional metadata.
![Chunk Node](../../../../assets/images/element-chunk-node.svg)
Chunk nodes contain the human readable text of a chunk and its vector embedding. They may contain additional metadata.
![Entity Node](../../../../assets/images/element-entity-node.svg)
Entity nodes contain the name of the entity. Additionally they might contain a description of the entity and a vector embedding (of name and description). They may contain additional metadata. Entity nodes can have additional labels based on the extraction prompt.

### Relationships

![PART_OF Relationship](../../../../assets/images/element-part-of-relationship.svg)
The PART_OF relationships do not require additional properties. However, they may contain additional metadata.

![HAS_ENTITY Relationship](../../../../assets/images/element-has-entity-relationship.svg)
The HAS_ENTITY relationships do not require additional properties. However, they may contain additional metadata.

![RELATES_TO Relationship](../../../../assets/images/element-relates-to-relationship.svg)
The RELATES_TO relationships are examplary here. They can have any type based on the extraction prompt. They may also have a description. They may contain additional metadata.

## Description

Use an LLM to execute entity and relationship extraction on the chunks. Import the retrieved triples into the Graph.

## GraphRAG Pattern

A Lexical Graph with Extracted Entities is used in the [Graph-Enhanced Vector Search](/reference/graphrag/graph-enhanced-vector-search).
